        <p>Welcome!</p>
        <p>This section of the tutorial will walk you through the inital setup up to the point
            where you have an exact replica of this tutorial website up and running.</p>
        <p>To get started, you will need a

            <!--This is a link. It contains the website we link to as a href (hypertext reference)-->
            <!--as well as the clickable link text. Here, we're linking to github.com and display -->
            <!--the term Github-->
            <!-- Here's how links work generally: <a href="website-we-link.to">Clickable link text</a>-->
            <a href="https://www.github.com">Github</a>

            account. If you don’t already have one, go to <a href="https://www.github.com">www.github.com</a> and create one.</p>
        <p>
            <!--Here's an image. Each image has a source (src).-->
            <!--The source can be "relative" or "absolute."-->
            <!--"Absolute" means that you provide a complete url, for example  -->
            <!--"Relative" means that we provide the path relative to where the current file is. -->
            <!--Below you see a relative path "images/setup_account_creation.png". -->
            <!--This tells the browser to load the "setup_account_creation.png" file from the -->
            <!--"images" folder. If you go to your repository, you can see that there is indeed -->
            <!--a "setup_account_creation.png" file there.-->
            <img src="images/tutorials/setup_account_creation.png" alt="Github Account Creation">

        <p>If you’re a student, you can sign up for the  <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">student developer pack</a>,
        which gives you access to a lot of different tools. The free account is also perfectly fine, though.</p>
        <p><img src="images/tutorials/setup_account_selection.png"
                alt="Github Account Selection"></p>
        <p>Once your account is set up, Github might ask you if want to create your first repository.
        “Repository” is Github’s name for a place where you can keep all of the files for one project
        or one website. However, we’re not going to create a new repository right now, so you can close
        the  dialog box.</p>
        <p><img src="images/tutorials/setup_repo_creation.png" alt="Don't initialize a repo"></p>
        <p>Instead of creating a new repository, we are going to copy the existing tutorial. To do this, go to
        the <a href="https://github.com/srisi/github_pages_tutorial/">Github website for this tutorial</a> and click
        on the “Fork” button in the top right corner.</p>
        <p>Forking means that you’re creating your own copy of the github_pages_tutorial repository, which
        you can now edit on your own.
        <img src="images/tutorials/setup_fork.png" alt="Github Pages Tutorial Website"></p>
        <p>Once the repository is copied, your screen should look like this. Now we just have one step left. We need to rename it.
            To do this, click on Settings.</p>
        <p><img src="images/tutorials/setup_repo_settings.png" alt="Forked github repo"></p>
        <p>By default, Github assumes that a repository just contains code. To make your new website visible
        to everyone, we need to follow Github’s naming scheme.</p>
        <p>Specifically, you need to rename your repository to <code>&lt;username&gt;.github.io</code>. In my case, it is
        <code>mit-risi.github.io</code>.</p>
        <p><img src="images/tutorials/setup_forked_website.png" alt="Github Forked Website"></p>
        <p>Voila, once this change is applied, your website is ready! It is an exact copy of this tutorial
        website ready for you to modify. Go to <code>&lt;username&gt;.github.io</code> to check it out.
        In my case, it's <a href="https://mit-risi.github.io">mit-risi.github.io</a></p>

        <p>Having a website is fun, but only if you can put your own material on it. Let's look at
            <a href="editing.html">how to edit it</a> next.</p>
